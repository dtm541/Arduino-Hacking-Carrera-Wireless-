Packet Sniffing the Carrera Wireless+ Protocol and DIY Hand Controller With Arduino

Carrera Toys is a popular manufacturer of slot car tracks, cars and accessories owned by Stadlbauer Marketing + Vertrieb GmbH. One of the products that they produce are the Wireless+ hand conrollers which allow radio conrolled racing over the 2.4 Ghz spectrum. The purpose of this repository is to facilitate the hacking and discovery of the over-the-air protocol of these controllers and to allow users to develop devices (eg Pistol-style controllers) to interact with the Wireless+ reciever.
